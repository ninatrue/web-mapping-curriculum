Class presentation materials are on [Google Drive here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nNNup7iSOsG-xhoxhEWfkNDnwiH74qQ1BbSGji2ql_4/edit#slide=id.g643643ac23_0_34)

__Homework__

For your class journal:

1. What is the difference between raster and vector data?


2. Why do "slippy maps" exist?

Slippy maps make it easier to scroll around a location to see just what is outside of the viewer without loading a whole new page. This is made possible with map tiles. In slippy maps, only the tiles that are on your screen are loaded (and some right outside the screen for faster scrolling around). 

3. Why would you want to install a dedicated text editor?



4. What is Leaflet?

Leaflet is a JavaScript library used to build interactive maps.

5. How has web map rendering changed over the years?

6. What is the basemap-overlay paradigm and how are GL maps different?

Exercises to do on your own:

1. Keep learning! Try one more of the Web apps tutorials on the [Mapbox help page](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/#web-apps) and submit your completed tutorial to your GitHub project.

Submitted under projects 

2. Head to the [Mapbox GL JS examples page](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) and pick two examples under the user interactions section. What kind of interactions do you see? Why might you use each of those interactions?

 a)"Create draggable Marker" - user can drag a marker and get coordinates. Users might find this helpful when looking at a map of green space, wild lands, trails, natioanl parks, etc. where there are no addresss. 

b) "Filter symbols by text input" user can type in a feature class and only symbols of that feature class will be displayed. This is helpful if a user is looking for a certain type of attraction with a city. They can search "coffee shops" and the map will filter out everything but "coffee shops". 


3. If you didn’t finish the “code together” exercise, please do so before next week.

Intro to interactivity

What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?

Interactions should be done tastefully! If it isn't tasteful, map designers should put in back in the toolbox. Designers should build interactions with a specific audience in mind and create clear pathways for users to follow. Designers should be thinking about their audience to help make decisions about which techniques to employ (UI/UX). 

Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”

Interactive maps turn map readers into map users. If maps are designed for interactivity, then the interactors are "map users". 

Common types of interaction

What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?

Geocoding converts addresses into geographic coordinates (Or vice versa with reverse geocoding). This can be used to find "goat yoga" in an area of interest. 

Intro to events

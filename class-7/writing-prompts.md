Web app cartography For the following prompts, please read through the cartography presentation here.

Color plays a significant role in the visualization of map data. What are some important considerations to keep in mind when choosing the appropriate color scheme for your map?

Why might you want to avoid using a rainbow color scheme?

Because rainbows kill people. It is ugly and unhelpful. Colors should be qualitative. 

List and describe 2-3 different thematic map types

1. Choropleth map: applies color to defined boundaries in proportion to data intensity 
2. Bubble map: bubbles are proportional map symbol- Bubbles get bigger as the data becomes more intense. 
3. Hexbin: displays data intensity in bins- not constrained by arbitary boundaries (like choropleth), less granular  than dot density, and good for showing general themes over a geography


What type of data is appropriately respresented by a sequential color scheme? What about a diverging color scheme?

Sequential- Population density (a little (light blue) - a lot (dark blue))
Diverging- NDVI (green (lots of healthy trees) - red (dying trees)) 


Can you name any tools (either from the presentation or your web travels) that would be helpful for choosing colors?

Color  brewer has been very helpful in my life. 


CORS and working with external data

In your own words, describe why web map developers have to think about CORS.

You have to think about CORS because some things might be private or scary and not everyone will have access to it. CORS keeps computer's safe. 

What is the concept of "separation of concerns?"

This is a design principal for separating a program into distinct sections. Each section addressess a different part of the program's information.

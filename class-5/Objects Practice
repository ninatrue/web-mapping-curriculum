/* *********************
        OBJECTS!
********************* */

// As we've discussed in class, JavaScript objects have a few characteristics that are useful for us when working writing programs.
  // 1. They store information in key:value pairs, which means you can access certain values by name instead of having to know the order of a list.
  // 2. You can put pretty much anything into an object, including strings, numbers, references to variables, even arrays and objects!

// Objects are great for creating structured data. Let's say you're running a dog-walking business and need to keep track of information about your furry clients. You might create an object like this:

var dogInfo = {
  name: "Scruffy",
  address: "123 Maple street",
  foods: ['kibble', 'canned', 'kale smoothie'],
  housebroken: false,
  pickUpTimes: {
    monday: '1pm',
    tuesday: '11am',
    wednesday: '1pm',
    thursday: '3pm',
    friday: '6am'
  }
}

// Now, say you want to write a program that prints out a dog's name and Monday pickup time. You can access that information using something called a "property accessor" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors).
// You can access a property using square brackets `[]` or a dot `.`

console.log(dogInfo.name);
console.log(dogInfo.pickUpTimes.monday);

// [PROMPT 1] Use a property accessor to print Scruffy's address.

console.log(dogInfo.address);

// [PROMPT 2] Construct a new object that stores information about your pet or a pet you know. Include: the pet's name, list of favorite foods, approximate age, and the color of its fur. Store that object as a variable called myPet.


var myPet = {
  name: "Holly", 
  foods: ['table scraps', 'the other dogs food', 'carrots'],
  age: 5, 
  color: "white"
}

// [PROMPT 3] Write a function with one parameter called "keyName". When the function is called, it should print the value associated with the key provided.

function print () {
  console.log(myPet.name)
}

print();
